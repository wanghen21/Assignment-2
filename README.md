# Assignment-2

#Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
##Purpose
####The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect stock information in 2017 and 2018 to determine if the stocks are worth the investment.

#Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

#Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

##What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
####The advantage of refactoring code is to clean, streamline the codes; it makes it easier to debug and understand the coding process. The disadvantage, personally, is that I don't remember how the original code looks after refactoring. 
####I am not quite sure if it is refactored correctly since I do not have a firm grasp on how VBA works. 
##How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
####The refactored codes would run faster, but I'm not sure if I had successfully done so.
